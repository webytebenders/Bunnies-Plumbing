# FULL PROMPT — Build Bunnies Plumbing & Trenchless Technology Website

## ROLE & OBJECTIVE

You are a senior frontend developer and web designer. Build a complete, professional, modern, and conversion-optimized website for **Bunnies Plumbing & Trenchless Technology** — a real plumbing company in Morgan Hill, CA that currently has NO website. This is a spec/demo site that will be pitched to the business owner for purchase.

The website must be a **single-page or multi-page static site using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. No frameworks, no React, no WordPress. It must look like a $3,000–$5,000 custom-built plumbing website. It must be fully responsive (mobile-first), fast-loading, and SEO-optimized.

- **No external dependencies** except Google Fonts CDN and Font Awesome CDN (for icons)
- All CSS in one stylesheet (or embedded)

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE
When Adhemar Castaneda opens this link on his phone between jobs, he should:
1. Immediately see his company name, phone number, and a professional design
2. Feel like "wow, this looks legit"
3. See his real reviews quoted on the site
4. See all his services listed accurately
5. Think "I need this — how much?"

The site should look indistinguishable from a $3,000–$5,000 custom plumbing website. It should make every competitor's site look amateur by comparison.

## FINAL NOTES
- Make the design PREMIUM. This is a pitch to sell. Every pixel matters.
- The phone number (408) 427-5318 should appear at least 5 times across the page
- Every section should have a CTA that leads to either calling or the contact form
- Use real data only — everything in this prompt is real and publicly available
- The site should work perfectly offline once loaded (no API dependencies)
- Test all responsive breakpoints: 320px, 375px, 425px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px

NOW BUILD THE COMPLETE WEBSITE. Output every line of code. Do not skip sections, do not use placeholder comments like "add more here". Build the entire thing, fully complete, production-ready.
